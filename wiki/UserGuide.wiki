= Introduction =
A ZTL file is a XML based format that is compiled by [http://zk-ztl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/org/zkoss/ztl/util/ZtlGenerator.html ZtlGenerator] to generate the Junit test case in Java.

= Write a ZTL Test Case =

=== Package ===
 The package of the test case is depended on where the file is located to the root directory. In this project, the directory is called *test*(you can use your own directory).

 For example, the _B30-123456_ file is under _test/org/zkoss/zkdemo/test2/B30-123456.ztl_, its package is _org.zkoss.zkdemo.test2.B30_123456Test.java_, the dash sign '-' will replace with the underscore sign '`_`' for the legal Java class name convention.

=== File Name ===
 The file name of the ZTL file will convert to Java class name, so it should be a legal Java class name.

=== Test ===
 The root tag in the ZTL file can enclose one or many [#Case Case].
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Default Value* || *Require* ||
|| import || the package that require to import to this test case || none || optional ||
|| tags || the tags to filter the test case, like _button_, _window_, _listbox_, and so on. || none || optional ||
|| context-path || the name(zkdemo) of the context path, like http://localhost:8080/zkdemo || according to *config.properites* || optional ||
|| server || the URL of the ZK server || according to *config.properites* || optional ||
|| action || the path that is visited by Selenium server|| according to *config.properites* || optional ||
|| delay || the delay time of each command run by Selenium ||according to *config.properites* || optional ||
|| timeout || the timeout of the waiting response from zk server, in millisecond||according to *config.properites* || optional ||
|| browser || the test case should be tested with all of the browser types ||according to *config.properites* || optional ||

=== Case ===
 The tag is like a method of Junit test case, and each [#Case Case] in the same [#Test Test] won't impact each other.
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Default Value* || *Require* ||
|| id || the name of the method in the Junit test case that starts with "test" automatically || none || *yes* ||

=== Server ===
 The content of the tag is run at ZK server, and each tag will fire a Ajax request to execute the code.
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Default Value* || *Require* ||
|| id || the id of the server || none || optional ||
|| ref || refer to the content of the server matched with the same id. i.e. the content of the tag will copy from the content of the server that id is matched. || none || optional ||
|| lang || the content of the language like *Java*, *Ruby*, and so on.(allowed ZK support only) || zul || optional ||

=== Client ===
 The content of the tag is run at Selenium server.
|| *Property* || *Description* || *Default Value* || *Require* ||
|| wait || the delay time of the command inside the tag, in millisecond || none || optional ||
