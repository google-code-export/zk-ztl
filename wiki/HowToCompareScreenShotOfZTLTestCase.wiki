= How to compare screen shot of ZTL test case =
== Define properties at config.properties ==
There are three properties about image comparing:
 * *baseimgdir*: Saved base capture images will be put this path.
 * *compareimgResult*: Images of conflict result will be put this path.
 * *iscompare*: To decide save capture images or compare them. It will compare images when this property is *true*, and save base images when it is *false*.
== Save capture for base ==
Please make sure:
 * *baseimgdir* has been defined. If not yet, it will fail the test that you use this function.
 * *iscompare* must be false.
Just call *verifyImage()* method. It will capture screen shot and save it into the base path.
== Compare current screen shot of test case with base ==
Please make sure:
 * *baseimgdir* has been defined, and base images must already exit.
 * *compareimgResult* has been defined.
 * *iscompare* must be true.
Just call 'verifyImage()' method.
== Output after comparing ==
If the snapshot mismatches with base image, this test will fail, and it will output image of comparing result into the 'compareimgResult' path. Please look following picture. Mismatching part will be marked by rectangles which borders are red.
