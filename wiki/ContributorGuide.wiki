#summary The guide is used to create a ZTL test case and contribute into this project.
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
== Introduction ==
Since ZK is a popular Ajax framework, we need to continue to maintain our high testing standards and find areas to improve upon. Automation is one of the best ways in which you can improve testing of your product which is the main reason for introducing ZTL, to make it easier to automate testing of ZK applications. We have begun the process of translating each of our zkdeme/test2 manual test cases to ZTL. Should you with to contribute a new test case or translate a manual test case to a ZTL you are more than welcome to. We will be using this tool to run through all test cases before ZK release or freshly builds.

== ZTL Naming Convention ==
 * For translating *zkdemo/test2/*, each ZTL file name should be the same as the test zul file.
  For example, *zkdemo/test2/B30-123456.zul*
  It should be *test/org/zkoss/zkdemo/test2/B30/B30-123456.ztl*
  And the tags of the test case should be the same as the *zkdemo/test2/config.properties*
 * For the additional test case, please follow the [#Contrbutor_Folder]

== Contributor Folder ==
 * If your ZTL file is not translated from our *zkdemo/test2/*, you should put your ZTL file under *test/org/zkoss/zkdemo/contributor/*
 * Before you commit, please verify that the test case can run on each browser.

== Rejection ==
 * Don't commit these directories into SVN repository
  # *ztl/build*
  # *ztl/codegen*
